DCP/VarDis Project
==================

The DCP/VarDis protocol stack is designed to support command and
control in drone networks. It works by piggybacking command and
control data onto frequently transmitted beacons. A description of the
protocol stack is available in this [arXiv
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01570). Currently, the project
contains the specification of the DCP/VarDis protocol stack, as well
as a simulator based on the OMNeT++ discrete-even simulation framework
([website](https://omnetpp.org)) and the INET module library for
OMNeT++ ([website](https://inet.omnetpp.org/)).

We welcome any contributions! If you are interested in contributing to
this project please get in touch with [Andreas
