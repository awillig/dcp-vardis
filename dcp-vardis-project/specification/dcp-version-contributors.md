## DCP Protocol Version

### Current Version

- Version 1.1, October 15, 2024

### Policy on Versioning

The specification of the DCP/VarDis protocol stack is versioned. The
version number follows the format 'X.Y' where 'X' is the major version
and 'Y' is the minor version. A new major version number is required
when 'breaking changes' are introduced such as:
  - Fields have been added to or removed from transmissible data
    types, or new transmissible data types have been introduced.
  - The semantics of an existing service offered by a protocol has
    been modified in an incompatible manner.

Note that the major version will be included in beacon frames, see [BP
Data Types](#subsubsec-beaconing-protocol-data-types).
