What's New
==========

This file details all the changes made to the DCP/VarDis simulation
model developed for OMNeT++/INET. This simulator has been created from
scratch once the first version of the DCP/VarDis specification has
been consolidated. It will be updated for minor and major releases of
the specification.




DCP/VarDis Version 1.0 (September 2024)
=======================================

This is the first publication of the simulator source code, including
a simple example simulation. It follows the DCP/VarDis specification
in version 1.0.
